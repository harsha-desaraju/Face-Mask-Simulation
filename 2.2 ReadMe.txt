The present code conisders 2 effects
1) Interception
2) Electric Effects

Assumptions involved in electric Effects:-

1) Fibers are infinetely long.
2) Fibers are uniformly charged and cylindrical.
   (Since fibers are uniformluy charged shell theorem is used to simplify the model)
3) The potential at a point is only due to 20 nearby fibers.



The model:
	Grid with fibers of thickness and thread pitch varying according to mentioned distribution along X and Y axis.
	Particles radius also varying as per mentioned distribution.
